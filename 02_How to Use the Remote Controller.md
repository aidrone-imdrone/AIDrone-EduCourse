- The power switch moves right to turn ON and left to turn OFF.
- When the power switch is turned ON, the red power button lights up.
- If the drone is not connected to the remote controller, the right square button (Drone Connect) will blink green.
- If the green light is blinking, the drone is not connected. To connect, press and hold the green blinking button for 3-4 seconds, and the green light will stay on continuously, indicating a successful connection.
- If the drone is not level, the right square button (Drone Connect) will not light up green. To fix this, place the drone on a flat surface, and the green light will turn on.
- If the drone is level but the right Drone Connect button does not light up green, press and hold Button 1 for 3-4 seconds to calibrate the sensors. This will ensure the green light stays on.
- During flight, pressing Button 2 will turn off the red power light (Power). Once the light turns off, the optical flow function is disabled, causing the drone to drift.
