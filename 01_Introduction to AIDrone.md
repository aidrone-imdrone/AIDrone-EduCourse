## 1. Product Overview
- **Product Name & Description** <br/> 
The AI Drone is an innovative educational drone designed for coding education and artificial intelligence (AI) learning.
Users can learn coding using Scratch or Python, and even experience immersive flight control using a remote controller.
When equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and an HD camera, the drone transforms into an all-in-one solution for
Linux programming practice, deep learning training, and AI application development.
AI Drone enables both fundamental and advanced AI and coding practices, fostering creative thinking and hands-on skills.

- **Key Features & Differentiation** <br/>
  Unlike traditional coding drones with an optical flow sensor, the AI Drone is enhanced with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and a camera, making it ideal for AI education.

- **Target Audience** <br/>
Middle school, high school, university students, and researchers

- **Applications** <br/>
Education, research, AI development, and drone programming
